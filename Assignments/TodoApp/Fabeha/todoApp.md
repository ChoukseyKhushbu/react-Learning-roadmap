I made this React app with basic functionality like Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Apart from basic functionality, I have some cool animations when you add or delete the task, also There is this live edit feature where you can see what you are editing and save it.

I used React Transition Group for the animations and React-UUID to get a unique ID for the todo, rest the app is made purely in React without redux or context state management.
